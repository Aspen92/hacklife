            <p>A life hack (or life hacking) is any trick, shortcut, skill, or novelty method that increases
                productivity
                and efficiency, in all walks of life. The term was primarily used by computer experts who suffer from
                information overload or those with a playful curiosity in the ways they can accelerate their workflow in
                ways other than programming.</p>

                    <p>Prevent your bathroom mirror from fogging up after a hot shower with car wax. Apply a small
                        amount of
                        car wax to the mirror, let it dry, then buff with a soft, dry cloth.</p>

                    <h2>Use This Simple Hack to Save Your Phone Charger</h2>
                    <p>To make your otherwise fragile phone charger last for more than a couple of weeks, try out this
                        simple hack! Start by removing the spring from a pen. Next, stretch one end of the spring out a
                        bit
                        so it can fit around the charger cable. You might need to use pliers for this. Now, wind the
                        spring
                        around the cable until it is completely on the charger cable. Next, take appropriately sized
                        heat
                        shrink tubing and slip it over the phone charger and spring. Use a lighter to warm the heat
                        shrink
                        tubing until it conforms around the charger and spring. This simple hack will keep the cord from
                        breaking any further or from even breaking in the first place!</p>

                    <h2>Fix Wobbly Furniture with a Penny</h2>
                    <p>Need to shim a wobbly bench or table, but don’t have time to run to the home center for furniture
                        feet? No worries, just reach for your pocket change!

                        You can use a coin to shim wobbly furniture in a pinch. Use hot glue to attach the coin to the
                        problem area, adding additional coins as needed. Coins work well as a temporary fix because they
                        come in a variety of thicknesses and cost less than a dollar!</p>

                    <h2>Use a Ceramic Mug as a Sharpening Stone</h2>
                    <p>The bottom of most ceramic coffee mugs have a flat, unglazed ring that is the perfect surface for
                        giving that dull knife or blade a quick sharpening. And if you find yourself in need of
                        sharpening a
                        utility knife, pocket blade or scissors and don’t have access to a sharpening stone, you can
                        simply
                        flip over a ceramic coffee mug and use the outer edge of the bottom, the non-glazed part, as an
                        emergency sharpening stone.

                        Just run the blade across the bottom of the mug at a 45-degree angle, working from the one end
                        of
                        the blade to the tip. Next, slide the blade downward in one direction, keeping your fingers out
                        of
                        the way as you work.

                        This isn’t a perfect solution for continually sharpening your blades, but if you need to quickly
                        sharpen and clean up the edge of a blade this method will do in a pinch. We do recommend
                        eventually
                        investing in a blade sharpening kit.</p>

                    <h2>How to Double Your Resealable Bags</h2>
                    <p>This might be the coolest way to turn sandwich-size bags into snack-size bags! Here’s how to do
                        it:
                        Heat up an old butter knife with a lighter and slice the bag in half. The hot knife cauterizes
                        the
                        edges of the two new bags.</p>
